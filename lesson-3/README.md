# Connecting Your State Machine to the Outside World
By now, you should have a good grasp of how to use draw.io with StateSmith, but I haven't shown you how to connect your state machine to the outside world.

We are going to jump over to [tutorial-3's lesson 3](https://github.com/StateSmith/tutorial-3/tree/main/lesson-3) for this as it already explains the concepts well.

Tutorial 3 uses PlantUML, but that's only important for the first two lessons.

Starting at lesson 3, you can mostly just browse the readme files, diagram image files, and the user code files. You don't need to understand PlantUML to follow along.

Thanks!
